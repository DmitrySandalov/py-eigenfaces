Python implementation of the eigenfaces technique
--------------------------------------------------

I provide a Python implementation of the eigenfaces
technique for representing real facial images using
an assortment of base images (computed by performing
an eigenanalysis of the face data matrix).

You can use the code with a variety of aligned face
image data sets, such as the FERET data set of faces.

First, throw all your aligned face images in "fas".
Then run "python eigenfaces.py". Wait until the script
terminates, and then look into your current directory.
